									        <h2>Phenotypic Evolution in an Age of Machine Learning</h2>
									   </header>
										
									   <div class="section clearfix">
										   <p>
									 	   The field of deep learning is advancing rapidly, and with it has come new tools for automated discovery, 
											   with systems such as <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2' target='_blank' style='color:blue;'>AlphaFold</a> and
											   <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6' target='_blank' style='color:blue;'>DeepMind's FunSearch</a> 
											   allowing users to pull new knowledge directly from high-dimensional data. I want to use similar tools to uncover the 
											   developmental processes underlying evolution, directly from raw data such as images or videos, and informed by pre-existing 
											   biological knowledge. With the massive datasets currently available to many researchers, Phenomics allows us to processes 
											   information with higher volume and dimensionality than was ever before possible. I want to take this a step further, and use 
											   machine learning to not only process more information than ever before, but also to rethink how our assumptions about the world 
											   interact with our data and models to begin with.

										    <img style="height:auto;width:45%; float:left;  margin: 15px 15px 0 0;" src="images/imageomics.jpg" alt="" />

									    <p>My work is centered around Imageomics, a new area of research that focuses on leveraging
										   knowledge-guided machine learning algorithms to answer difficult biological questions. While this 
										   idea can be interpreted and executed in many ways, as a macroevolutionary researcher, I am interested 
										   in incorporating structures like phylogenies and ontologies to hard-bake established Evo-Devo
										   knowledge into the process of phenotypic character construction. 
										</p>
									    <p>Generally Speaking, "character construction" refers to the process of identifying, defining, and 
										   categorizing the traits or features of organisms that are relevant for phylogenetic analysis or 
										   other comparative studies. Practically all of our models for understanding evolution require some
										   sort of prerequisite character construction step, but there is no established generic framwork for 
										   undergoing this process. This is because doing so would be almost impossible with past technology, as researchers 
										   are often asking very different questions, and finding variables that can be leveraged to answer those
										   questions requires a knowledge of the broader world that something like a more standard GLM
										   generally cannot have.

									    <p></p>
									    <p>Using Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) approaches, 
										    While deep learning models can fit functions to any sort of data, they still always include inductive 
										    assumptions about how that data behaves / the processes that led to it being what it is. When dealing 
										    with images, convolutional neural networks allow us to incorporate biases about the spatial distribution 
										    of patterns. When dealing with time-series data, LSTMs allow us to incorporate biases about the order of 
										    elements in a sequence. 
									    </p>
									    <p> When dealing with evolutionary data, we can incorporate similar biases, by using clever restructuring of 
										    autoencoders and multi-task learning algorithms to bias our models with information from phylogeny, 
										    ontogeny, or other biological processes. In this way, we can ground increasingly high-dimensional, or 
										    even raw, datasets in our understanding of reality, and possibily discover new processes that we far more 
										    difficult to uncover previously.

										    <h3>Simulating Raw Data</h3>
										    <img style="height:auto;width:50%; float:left;  margin: 15px 15px 0 0;" src="images/t1_Top_0.png" alt="" />

								            <p>Most phenotypic traits are complex characters, whos evolutionary paths are determined by 
										dynamic changes in regulatory networks with various degrees of integration, complexity, and ... .
										Deep learning may allow us to uncover these sophisticated processes so that they can be better represented
										in our models, but many deep learning algorithms are black boxes, and validating the performance of black-box 
										    models that uncover unknown processeses in irregularly structured data is incredibly difficult.
									    </p>
									    <p>One way to address this issue is by instead validating the ability of these models to discover known processes 
										    through simulated raw data, which can be done with the 
										    <a href='https://github.com/calcharp/TraitBlender' target='_blank' style='color:blue;'>TraitBlender</a> pipeline I developed. 
										    TraitBlender allows users to represent theoretical morphospaces as python functions, which can be be used to evolve imaginary
										    taxa on a simulated phylogeny. TraitBlender can then take 'museum-specimen' style photos of these imaginary taxa in bulk, 
										    allowing users to create huge synthetic image datasets where the evolutionary and developmental processes are known in their entireties. 
									    </p>

										    <h3>Incorporating Structured Knowledge into Inference</h3>
										    <img style="height:auto;width:50%; float:left;  margin: 15px 15px 0 0;" src="images/phenoscape.png" alt="" />

									    <p>Whenever we make models, we are attempting to codify statements about the world. 
										For a model to be meaningful, however, the assumptions we put into it must be reflective 
										    of our assumptions about external reality. When we are dealing with traits that have 
										    complex, nonlinear dependencies on each other, doing this can be very difficult.</p>
									
									    <p>I've contributed to projects that address this problem by incorporating biological knowledge 
										    into models directly in the form of ontologies, which are knowledge graphs that specifify
										    the hierarchical relationships / dependencies between traits. </p>
