									        <h2>Phenotypic Evolution in an Age of Machine Learning</h2>

										   <p>
									 	   The field of deep learning is advancing rapidly, and with it has come new tools for automated discovery, 
											   with systems such as Alphafold and Deepmind's FunSearch allowing users to pull new knowledge directly
											   from high-dimensional data. I want to use similar tools to uncover the developmental processes underlying
											   evolution, directly from raw data such as images or videos, and informed by pre-existing biological knowledge. 
											   With the massive datasets currently available to many researchers, Phenomics allows us to processes information 
											   with higher volume and dimensionality than was ever before possible. I want to take this a step further, and 
											   use machine learning to not only process more information than ever before, but also to rethink how our assumptions 
											   about the world interact with our data and models to begin with.

									    <p>My work is centered around Imageomics, a new area of research that focuses on leveraging
										   knowledge-guided machine learning algorithms to answer difficult biological questions. While this 
										   idea can be interpreted and executed in many ways, as a macroevolutionary researcher, I am interested 
										   in incorporating structures like phylogenies and ontologies to hard-bake established Evo-Devo
										   knowledge into the process of phenotypic character construction. 
										</p>
									    <p>Generally Speaking, "character construction" refers to the process of identifying, defining, and 
										   categorizing the traits or features of organisms that are relevant for phylogenetic analysis or 
										   other comparative studies. Practically all of our models for understanding evolution require some
										   sort of prerequisite character construction step, but there is no established generic framwork for 
										   undergoing this process. This is because doing so would be almost impossible with past technology, as researchers 
										   are often asking very different questions, and finding variables that can be leveraged to answer those
										   questions requires a knowledge of the broader world that something like a more standard GLM
										   generally cannot have.

									    <p>The field of deep learning is advancing rapidly, and with it has come new tools for automated discovery, 
										    with systems such as Alphafold and Deepmind's FunSearch allowing users to pull new knowledge directly 
										    from high-dimensional data. I want to use similar tools to uncover the developmental processes underlying evolution, 
										    directly from raw data such as images or videos. </p>
									    <p>Using Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) approaches, 
										    I want to constrain these models so that their predictions are informed by formally structured knowledge such as 
										    phylogeny or ontogenic processes, so that they can develop meaningful interpretations of the dynamic 
										    processes underlying evolution.</p>

								            <p>Many machine learning methods, such as neural networks, operate as 
									       "Black Boxes", making it difficult to understand their results and interpret their decisions.
									       This issue is particularly problematic when trying to automatically construct biological	    
									       traits, which are themselves extremely complex, and are often constructed and used 
									       differently by different researchers.</p>

										    <img style="height:auto;width:50%; float:left;  margin: 15px 15px 0 0;" src="images/phenoscape.png" alt="" />

									    <p>Whenever we make models, we are attempting to codify statements about the world. 
										For a model to be meaningful, however, the assumptions we put into it must be reflective 
										    of our assumptions about external reality. When we are dealing with traits that have 
										    complex, nonlinear dependencies on each other, doing this can be very difficult.</p>
									
									    <p>I've contributed to projects that address this problem by incorporating biological knowledge 
										    into models directly in the form of ontologies, which are knowledge graphs that specifify
										    the hierarchical relationships / dependencies between traits. </p>
